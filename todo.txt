The Idea:

Build a very simple Github copilot-like app using ChatGPT as the backend,
	but only use ChatGPT to write the code without typing anything myself

We need:
	- Extract instructions and relevant code from codebase
		- Comment with prefix for now and scan the files every X seconds?
			//gpt write function that does xxxx
	- A way to send instructions and code to ChatGPT
		- Rest API POST call ( https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/conversation )
	- A way to get the results
		- Same api call, result is streamed via EventSource
		- Need to make sure to only extract code and ignore all the talking
	- Insert the results into the codebase
		- Simple replace comment with results?
		- Probably automatically git commit before every change?
